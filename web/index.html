   <div class="col-md-6"><h4>After helping his team to a big win over Sri Lanka in the first Test at Galle, ace India opener Shikhar Dhawan seems to have taken his form over to video games as well, as he was pictured celebrating his victory against fellow Indian teammates while playing FIFA, on Saturday.<br><br>Dhawan starred with a sensational 168-ball 190 in the first innings that helped India pile on 600 runs and it set the tone for the visitors for the rest of the match. Dhawan also picked up the man of the match for his heroics in the Test.<br><br>India trumped the hosts inside four days and that gave them enough time to try their hands at video games. In a picture uploaded on social media by batman Rohit Sharma, the southpaw is seen taking the mickey out of Cheteshwar Pujara and KL Rahul and it seems that he beat them in FIFA very comfortably.<br><br>The Second test is going to start on 3rd July and once again the eye will be on Shikhar Dhawan who have played a magnificent inning of 190 in first inning of first test match.</h4></div>
